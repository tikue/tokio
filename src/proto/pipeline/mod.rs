//! A dispatcher for pipelining protocols
//!
//! This module contains reusable components for quickly implementing clients
//! and servers for pipeline based protocols.
//!
//! # Pipelining
//!
//! Protocol pipelining is a technique in which multiple requests are written
//! out to a single destination without waiting for their corresponding
//! responses. Pipelining is used in a multitude of different protocols such as
//! HTTP/1.1 and Redis in order to increase throughput on a single connection.
//!
//! Pipelining with the max number of in-flight requests set to 1 implies that
//! for each request, the response must be received before sending another
//! request on the same connection.
//!
//! Another protocol dispatching strategy is multiplexing (which will be
//! included in Tokio soon).
//!
//! # Usage
//!
//! Both the server and client pipeline dispatchers take a generic `Transport`
//! that reads and writes `Frame` messages. It operates on the transport
//! following the rules of pipelining as described above and exposes the
//! protocol using a `Service`.
